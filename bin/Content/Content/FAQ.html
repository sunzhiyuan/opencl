        <i><b>My mobile device is plugged in, and my application is running. Why is nothing listed
        in Adreno Profiler's connection box?</b></i>
        <DIV CLASS="Indent">
          <P>
            • Confirm USB drivers have been installed for your device according to the
            instructions in <A HREF="DeviceInstallation.html">Device Installation</A>.
          </P>
		  <P>
		    • Before an Android application may be profiled, it must have the android.permission.INTERNET permission enabled in its manifest. 
          </P>
		  <P>
            • Before profiling, and after rebooting your Android device, you must enable debug mode by setting the following ADB property on the command-line:
            <DIV CLASS="Indent">
            <P>
              <b>adb.exe shell setprop debug.egl.profiler <i><1 to enable, 0 to disable></i></b>
            </P>
            </DIV>
		    <P>
            On 2.x versions of Adreno Profiler this step is done for you automatically. Simply launch the Adreno Profiler connect dialog before launching your application. 
			</P>
		  </P>
          <P>
            • For Windows Mobile devices, Adreno Profiler must be running, and ActiveSync connected,
            <b>before</b> starting the embedded graphics application.
          </P>
          <P>
            • Make sure the embedded application creates a <b>hardware-accelerated</b> OpenGLES
            context, and is not falling back to a software reference driver.
          </P>
          <P>
            • If ActiveSync or Android Debug Bridge crashes or closes abnormally, Adreno Profiler
            may be unable to scan the device after it has been reconnected. Close and restart
            Adreno Profiler.
          </P>
          <P>
            • If you use firewall software, ensure that its exception list includes Adreno Profiler
            (AdrenoProfiler.exe).
          </P>
          <DIV CLASS="Indent">
            <P>
              - Additionally, if using a Windows Mobile device, ensure all ActiveSync processes and
              services are also listed as firewall exceptions: <b>rapimgr.exe</b>, <b>wcescomm.exe</b>,
              <b>WCESMgr.exe</b>, and port <b>26675</b> for the ActiveSync Service.
            </P>
            <P>
              - If using an Android or BREW-based device, no additional firewall exceptions are needed.
            </P>
            <P>
              - If the above suggestions do not resolve your connection problem, please contact

        <i><b>The Scrubber is not rendering my captured frame correctly.</b></i>

        <i><b>When profiling a DirectX application, why does the profiler crash with an error about missing dll or relevant depedencies?
        </b></i>
        <DIV CLASS="Indent">
          <P>
            If you get the error, "System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'DXPlaybackWrapper.dll' or one of its dependencies.<br> 
            The specified module could not be found. File name: 'DXPlaybackWrapper.dll'", this is most likely due to DirectX runtime not being installed
            on your machine. <br>Please install DirectX Runtime from <a HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35">this</a> location.
