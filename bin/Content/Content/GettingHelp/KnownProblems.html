          When scrubbing OpenGL ES v1.1 content using the OpenGL ES scrubber, fog and alpha test
          will be disabled in the scrubber's emulator view. This is because fog and alpha test are
          implemented on the device using hardware-specific shader extensions that are not supported in
          desktop video cards.
        </P>
        <BR />

          On some devices, toggling program overrides globally off (via the Programs Browser toolbar)
          will erroneously disable <u>all</u> overrides, including those set from the Overrides Browser.
        </P>
        <BR />

          Due to side effects of capturing Scrubber metrics, if at least one Scrubber metric is added to
          a Scrubber GL document, subsequent frame captures will <b>not</b> report any resolve and
          unresolve operations triggered by the captured frame.
        </P>
        <BR />
        <P>

          Creating multiple scrubber documents is not supported in this release of Adreno Profiler.
        </P>

          OpenGL ES v3.0 application profiling is not supported on the OSX version of Profiler at this time.
        </P>

          UI controls will sometimes not resize properly on Linux and OSX.  Try resizing the whole
          window to force the controls to resize.
