      <P>
        This tutorial explains how to capture performance information for individual render calls.
      </P>

      <P>
        After <A HREF="../Connect.html">connecting</A> to a device, create a new scrubber via the main toolbar.
      </P>

      <BR />

      <P>
		Click ont he 'Metrics' drop down menu on the Trace view toolstrip to get the list of metrics supported by the connected
		device. The tooltip displays information about the selected metric.
        <DIV CLASS="Indent">
          <P>
            • <i>Note that Scrubber metrics are only supported by Adreno 200+ series devices.</i>
          </P>
        </DIV>
      </P>

      <BR />

      <P>
        Click on the desired metric and a column should be added to the Trace view were values will be populated upon capture. Please note that
		if a capture has been done previous to attaching metrics the scene needs to get recaptured for the values to get populated.

        To enable and capture a Scrubber metric:
        <DIV CLASS="Indent">
          <P>
            <img src="../../Images/Arrow.bmp" />
            Click on the disred metric from the Metrics drop down. The metric
            will appear as a new column in the <A HREF="../../Reference/Scrubber2xCallTrace.html">call trace listing</A>
            at the bottom of the Scrubber. Multiple Scrubber metrics may be enabled this way.
            <DIV CLASS="Indent">
              <P>
                • <i>Note that due to concurrency restrictions in the embedded hardware, there are limits to how many
                metrics can be enabled simultaneously. Adreno Profiler will convey those limitations by highlighting
                metrics in red as they become unavailable.</i>
              </P>
            </DIV>
          </P>
          <P>
            <img src="../../Images/Arrow.bmp" />
            Next, <A HREF="CaptureAndScrubFrames_GLES2.html">Capture</A> a new frame from the device. After the
            frame downloads, any metrics columns you have added will be filled with the values of the
            enabled metrics for each render call within the frame.
          </P>
        </DIV>
      </P>

      <BR />

      <P>
        To stop capturing a metric, click on the metric again within the Metrics drop down menu.
      </P>

      <BR />

      <P>
        <b>Scrubber metrics can be visualized in several ways:</b>
      </P>
      <P>
        <img src="../../Images/Arrow.bmp" />
        By default, the collected metrics are displayed as a vertical histogram alongside the API calls.
        <DIV CLASS="Indent">
          <P>
            <img src="CaptureRendercallMetrics_GLES2_3.png" />
          </P>
        </DIV>
      </P>
      <P>
        <img src="../../Images/Arrow.bmp" />
        You can also view the raw numerical metric data. Select this mode using the toolbar above the call trace.
        <DIV CLASS="Indent">
          <P>
            <img src="CaptureRendercallMetrics_GLES2_4.png" />

        </DIV>
      </P>
      <P>
        <img src="../../Images/Arrow.bmp" />
        If you click on a column in the call trace that contains metrics data, the scene in the emulator
        view will be colorized according to the selected metric as shown in the following screenshot.
