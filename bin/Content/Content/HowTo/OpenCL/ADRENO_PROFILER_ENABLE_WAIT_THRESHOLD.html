		<p><h3><i><b>Summary:</b></i></h3></p>
		<p>
			Property used to modify the default threshold for the amount of time after the last API called to stop trying to connect to profiler.
		</p>
		<p><h3><i><b>Usage:</b></i></h3></p>
		<p>
			To modify the threshold:
		</p>
		<br>
			<div align="center">
				<img src="images/adb_shell_setprop_ADRENO_PROFILER_ENABLE_WAIT_THRESHOLD_N.png"/>
			</div>
		<br>
		<p>
			Where N is the number of seconds that profiler should wait before stop trying to connect to profiler.
		</p>
		<p><h3><i><b>Description:</b></i></h3></p>
		<p>
			While an application is executed with OpenCL profiling enabled, the connection mechanism on the application will fall into sleep mode after 5 seconds passed since the last OpenCL API and will revive when another API is called.
		</p>
		<p>
			The default time is 5 seconds and for most use case scenarios this is more than enough time to connect to profiler. In fact, on OpenCL/OpenGL interoperability there's  usually no need to touch this property as most likely OpenCL API's will be called every frame which resets the count down.
		</p>
		<p>
			An application needs to execute at least one API in order for the driver to be able to bootstrap the connection mechanism.  If (for example) an APK with a menu that requires user interaction is implemented and the developer would want to be able to establish a connection while standing on the menu (most likely scenario to attempt to profile from the beginning of the application) a harmless API such as clGetPlatformIDs can be called before the menu to bootstrap the connection mechanism on the application.
