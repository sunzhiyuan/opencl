		There are two types of Graphers that can be used depending on the requirements. 'App Metrics Graph' requires an application
		running and will display metrics related to that process only. To open an 'App Metrics Graph' you will need to <A HREF="Connect.html">connect</A>
		to a device. 'Global Metrics Graph' doesn't require an application running as it gathers metrics for the whole device, this button will enable
		if global metrics are supported by the current device.

        Note that multiple graphs can be created and viewed side-by-side. To create a new document pane, drag a document
        tab a short distance, then let go (Note: this only applies to the Windows version of Adreno Profiler). Choose an orientation from the menu that appears.

        Once the <A HREF="../Reference/Grapher.html">Grapher</A> appears, switch to the

        The bottom portion of the Metrics Browser displays information about the selected metric.

        To begin capturing an individual metric, drag its label from the Metrics Browser and drop it on to a 
        Grapher document. A metric line control will be added to the grapher with the chosen metric.
        <DIV CLASS="Indent">
          <P>
            • <i>Note that due to concurrency limitations in the embedded CPU and GPU, there are limits to how many
            metrics can be simultaneously enabled. As a result, turning on a metric may cause others to become
            unavailable - Adreno Profiler will highlight those unavailable metrics in red.</i>

        To stop capturing a metric, click the close button beside the metric in Metrics Browser or the close button <img src="CloseIcon.png" />
        within the metric line control shown in Grapher. A list of Grapher documents currently plotting the metric 
        will appear; select the Grapher you wish to cease plotting the metric.

	  <P>Each metric line is a separate control and has controls that can affect its appereance, order or layout. 
		The various operations permitted per metric line are the following:

        On Adreno 200+ series devices, the Grapher metrics report frequency can be changed. To do so, click
        on the button labeled "Freq" on the toolbar.
