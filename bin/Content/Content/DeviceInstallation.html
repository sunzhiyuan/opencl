          For Android devices, the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) must be installed in order to use Adreno Profiler.
          ADB should be downloaded as part of the latest Android SDK release from Google, which may be obtained
          from the following link:
          <DIV CLASS="Indent">
            <P>
              <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a>
            </P>
          </DIV>
        </P>
        <P>
          After downloading and unpacking the Android SDK, add the path location of <b>adb.exe</b> and <b>AdbWinApi.dll</b>
          to your system PATH environment variable.  Ensure that there are no versions of ADB in the profiler directory and
		  no additional versions of ADB are accessible via the PATH environment variable.
        </P>
        <P>
          An appropriate USB driver must also be installed for your Android device.  A Windows USB driver for the HTC G1 may
          be obtained here:
          <DIV CLASS="Indent">
            <P>
              <a href="http://dl.google.com/android/android_usb_windows.zip">http://dl.google.com/android/android_usb_windows.zip</a>
            </P>
          </DIV>
        </P>
        <P>
          Additionally, before an Android application may be profiled, it must have the <b>android.permission.INTERNET</b>
          and <b>com.qti.permission.PROFILER</b> permissions enabled in its manifest.
        </P>
        <P>
          Finally, before profiling, and after rebooting your Android device, you must enable debug mode by setting the following ADB
          property on the command-line:
          <DIV CLASS="Indent">
            <P>
              <b>adb.exe shell setprop debug.egl.profiler <i><1 to enable, 0 to disable></i></b>
            </P>
          </DIV>
		  
		  On 2.x versions of Adreno Profiler this step is done for you automatically.  Simply launch the Adreno Profiler connect dialog
		  before launching your application.
        </P>
		
		Note:  If Adreno Profiler is having difficulty connecting to your application, try killing the ADB server with <i>adb kill-server</i>
		on the command line.  Then close your application, launch Adreno Profiler, then launch your application and attempt to connect again.
      </P>
