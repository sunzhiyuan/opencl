<h1 align="center">QUALCOMM Adreno&trade; SDK Readme</h1>
<hr>

Welcome to QUALCOMM's Adreno&trade; Software Development Kit (SDK). This SDK includes tools, libraries, samples, and documentation that aim to help you develop mobile graphics applications optimized for QUALCOMM's Adreno GPU in the Snapdragon SoC.

Use the shortcuts to launch the Adreno&trade; SDK Browser to get started.

<p>
<p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<hr>

<p>
         1. Graphics Card - Radeon X1300 (or higher) is recommended. Note that your graphics card must  
		                    support OpenGL 3.3 or higher to use OpenGL ES 3.0 features in the emulator.
<p>
         2. Operating System - Windows (XP, Vista, 7) or Linux
<p>
         3. Development Environments Supported - Visual Studio 2010, Cygwin (Android), Linux GCC, Eclipse (Android)
<p>
         4. Drivers - For AMD graphics cards, download the latest Catalyst
                      driver from AMD's web site : <a href="http://www.ati.com/"> http://www.ati.com </a>
<p>
         5. Other Software - On Linux platforms, the FreeImage development library must be installed to build certain utilities.

<h2>Details</h2>
<hr>

The Adreno&trade; SDK includes the Browser, Samples, Tutorials, Demos, Documentation, Libraries, Tools, and the OpenGL ES 3.0 Emulator. The Adreno&trade; SDK Browser is the best starting point for anything in the SDK and acts as your portal to the SDK's contents. 
<p>

If you're looking to understand how to implement certain graphics techniques or features for OpenCL or OpenGL ES, then check out the Tutorials, Samples, and Demos. A number of Tools are provided to aid in graphics application prototyping or for working with your mobile device through the PC.
<p>
The Adreno Texture Tool allows you to view and compress textures optimized for QUALCOMM hardware, including the ETC1 and ETC2 OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0 compression formats.
<p>
The OpenGL ES 3.0 Emulator emulates the QUALCOMM Adreno&trade; hardware. For more information, please see <a href="80-VN411-1_A_Adreno_Unified_Emulator_UG.pdf">80-VN411-1_A_Adreno_Unified_Emulator_UG.pdf</a>.

<p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<hr>
1. The SDK framework code currently supports 32 bit displays only. Additional
   depths will be added in the future.
<p>
2. In the case that an error occurs while uninstalling the SDK, you can force the
   SDK to re-install on top of the old one by first running REGEDIT.EXE and
   searching for "Adreno", then deleting the first directory that comes up.
