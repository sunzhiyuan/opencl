<H1>FBX Model Converter</H1>
This is a tool to convert a Filmbox (FBX) file to a custom binary mesh and animation file format used by the Snapdragon&trade; SDK sample code. Source code for the tool is provided so that users may extend the tool to support additional source file formats and/or add additional commands for mesh processing. The destination mesh file format is designed to minimize the load time of meshes, requiring a minimal amount of run-time processing on an embedded device.
<p>
For more information on FBXModelConverter, please see the included documentation, located with the command line tool FBXModelConverter.exe, within the Utilities/bin directory of the SDK.
