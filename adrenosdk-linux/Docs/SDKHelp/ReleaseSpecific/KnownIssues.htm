<H1>Known Issues</H1>

<OL>
<LI>Currently, the SDK runs on a Windows XP / Vista / 7 machine with a Radeon X1300 or higher graphics card.</LI>
<LI>The Procedural Texture sample takes a while to initialize. This time is spent generating the required 3D textures.</LI>
<LI>The MotionBlur sample's performance on Adreno&trade; hardware cannot currently be approximated.</LI>
<LI>Currently, the SDK Installer has no way of checking to see if a user's machine has a valid graphics card or not. Support for this will be added in a future release.</LI>
<LI>The SDK framework currently only supports 32 bit displays. Support for additional color depths will be added in the future.</LI>
<LI>In order to remove a single installed component, please select 'modify' at the time of the uninstall. This will be improved in the next release.</LI>
<LI>If an error occurs while uninstalling the SDK, you can force the SDK to re-install on top of the old one by first running REGEDIT.EXE and searching for "Adreno", and deleting the first directory that comes up.</LI>
<LI>The uninstall action will currently leave behind any folders that have been updated since the installation of the SDK.  This will be fixed in later releases.</LI>
<LI>Multimon issue - if you use a configuration with a secondary monitor positioned  with negative Windows coordinates (left or top of the primary monitor), OpenGL will have a problem rendering when the application’s window is on the primary monitor.
 <br><br>
   Workaround 1: move the application’s window to the secondary monitor
<br><br>
   Workaround 2: change multimon configurations to not have negative Windows coordinates (reposition the secondary monitor to the left or bottom of the primary monitor)</LI>
