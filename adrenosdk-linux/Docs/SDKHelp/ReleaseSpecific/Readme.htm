You should be profficient in C, C++ programming with atleast an entry level knowledge of 3D graphics. A background in games programming will also be very helpful.

<LI>Currently, the SDK runs only on a Windows XP machine with Radeon X1300 or higher graphics card.</LI>
<LI>ImageEffects sample takes about 15 sec. to initialize. This time is spent generating the 3D textures required for the image effects.</LI>
<LI>The MotionBlur sample's performance on Adreno&trade; hardware cannot currently be approximated.</LI>
<LI>Currently, the SDK Installer has no way of checking if the user's machine has a valid graphics card or not. This will be added in the future versions.</LI>
<LI>The SDK framework code currently supports 32 bit displays only. Additional depths will be added in the future.</LI>
<LI>In order to remove a single installed component, please select 'modify' at the time of the uninstall. This will be improved in the next version.</LI>
<LI>In the case that an error occurs while uninstalling the SDK, you can force the SDK to re-install on top of the old one by first running REGEDIT.EXE and
   searching for "Adreno", then deleting the first directory that comes up.</LI>
