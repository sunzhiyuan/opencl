<H1>Details</H1>
This demo represnts a broad cross-section of usable shader examples that can be readily understood and used in other applications. With examples as simple as ambient lighting to more esoteric shading methods, a developer can start here to find a shading method that suits their needs and adapt the example to their own application. There are 50 examples in total. 
<p>
This demo is written to be cross-platform with both Windows (XP, Vista and Windows 7) and Android (2.1 and higher). To navigate the different examples, simply tap or click on the left and right sides of the screen to decrement or advance through them.
