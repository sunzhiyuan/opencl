This sample demonstrates how to program the accelerometer sensor found on many Snapdragon devices.

<H1>Details</H1>

An accelerometer is used to detect acceleration of a device in all three dimensions. Using this information, we can deduce positional movement 
of the device and use this to control various aspects of our application.
<p>
The Accel application constructs a scene with a set of objects and a camera directly overhead. When the device is tilted, the camera moves on
the X/Z plane in a smooth motion. 
<p>
Calibrating the device is an important step when using sensors to cut down on the drift that accumulates when reading and integrating values
coming from sensors. Lay the device flat on a surface and touch the screen; calibration will take place while the this is happening. The longer you touch the 
screen and the more still it is, the better the calibration results are and the less drift will occur.
<p>
<i>The application does not take into account any orientation (that involves more sensor math then what is in the application). It only works properly
when the device is oriented flat with the back of the device facing the ground.

NOTE: This sample compiles for both windows and Android, but requires an Android device to see the sensor in action.
