This sample demonstrates how to program the gyrospcope sensor found on many Snapdragon devices.

<H1>Details</H1>

A gyroscope is used to track the angular rotation of a device in all three dimensions. Using this information, we can solve for the 
orientation of the device and use this to control various aspects of our application.
<p>
The Gyro application constructs a scene with a set of objects and a camera directly overhead. When the device is rotated on the x and y axis,
the camera shifts to stay aligned with the device. The resulting effects is as if one is looking into a 'window', and can trick the mind into seeing
the objects as being true 3D (without 3D glasses!).
<p>
Calibrating the device is an important step when using sensors to cut down on the drift that accumulates when reading and integrating values
coming from sensors. Lay the device flat on a surface and touch the screen; calibration will take place while the this is happening. The longer you touch the 
screen and the more still it is, the better the calibration results are and the less drift will occur.

NOTE: This sample compiles for both windows and Android, but requires an Android device to see the sensor in action.
