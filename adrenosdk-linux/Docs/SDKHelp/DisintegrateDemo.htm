<H1>Disintegrate Demo</H1>

The Disintegrate Demo is an OpenGL ES 2.0 graphics sample that shows off advanced procedural rendering. The demo is also cross-platform, with builds tested for both Windows (XP, Vista and 7) and Android (2.1 and higher).
<p>
The demo takes an object (in this case, a ghost model) and, upon tapping on the screen (or using the mouse to point and click when running on Windows), turns it into clouds of point sprites, resulting in the illusion of the object 'disintegrating' and 're-integrating' in another location.
