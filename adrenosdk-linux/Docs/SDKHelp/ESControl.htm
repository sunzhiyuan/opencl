<H1>ES_Control - OpenGL ES 2.0 Emulator Control Panel</H1>

ES_Control is a control panel used to set configuration options for QUALCOMM's OpenGL ES 2.0 Emulator.  QUALCOMM's OpenGL ES 2.0 Emulator is designed to estimate the performance of an OpenGL ES 2.0 application running on an QUALCOMM Adreno&trade; GPU.  The control panel enables users to configure rendering options along with various debugging features.  The default values chosen for the Emulator configuration options are reasonable values that typical users will not need to modify. These features, along with all the other configuration options, are described in the rest of this document.

<H1>Emulator Environment</H1>

<H2>Screen Size</H2>
Select the desired screen width and height
<UL>
<LI>The width and height are used for max viewport dimensions and max render buffer sizes.  When “Not Specified” is selected then the max sizes are 2048.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Available GPU Memory (MB)</H2>
Set the amount of memory available to the GPU for textures, VBOs, FBOs, and Color/Depth/Stencil buffers (0 means there is no limit)
<UL>
<LI>With desktop GPUs the drivers can swap textures and VBOs out to system memory when video memory is exhausted.  However, on mobile platforms there is a limited amount of memory that can be used.  Anytime the amount of memory used exceeds this number a GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY error is generated.</LI>
</UL>

<H1>Debugging Output</H1>
Check for emulator errors and OpenGL ES errors at the end of every entry point and pipe these errors to the selected output method
<UL>
<LI>None - This method does no error checking.  This mode provides best performance.</LI>
<LI>Debugger Break - When a debugger is attached an int3 is triggered on any error which allows you to break on the entry point causing the error.  Text describing any errors is also printed to the debugger output.  If a debugger is not running the application will seem to crash on the first error detected.</LI>
<LI>Debugger Output - When a debugger is attached, text describing any errors is printed to the debugger output.</LI>
<LI>Text File - A text file called ES2_Debug.txt is created and any errors are written into this file.</LI>
<LI>App Window - The most recent error detected is displayed at the top of the application's window.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Force This Program ID to Magenta</H2>
Change the fragment shader that is attached to the selected program ID to output magenta
<UL>
<LI>This is useful for debugging shaders.  The program ID can be most easily attained by dumping detailed performance logs to a file and viewing the ES2_PerfDumpShaders.txt file.</LI>
</UL>

<H1>S3D Variables</H1>
These variables are used to render an ES 2.0 emulated application in stereo. This current implementation will split the application screen in half and render the output on each side, one for the left eye and one for the right. The variables that are defined in this section of the ES Control tool are used to globally assign the spatialization of the images. Note that it is up to the application to increase the width of the application if more horizontal resolution is required.

<H2>Enable S3D</H2>
Enables the S3D mode on. This is global; any ES 2.0 emulated application will be affected by this.

<H2>Eye Width</H2>
This is the amount of eye separation between the two images. The greater the value, the further apart the ‘eyes’ are (increases the overall stereoscopic nature of the resulting image, but can lead to unnatural effects at high values).

<H2>View Shift 2D</H2>
The amount to shift 2D polygons by (i.e. polys that are rendered with the z-buffer turned off).

<H2>View Shift 3D</H2>
The amount to shift 3D polygons by (i.e. polys that are rendered with the z-buffer turned on).


<H1>Other Variables</H1>

<H2>Use ES Shader Compiler</H2>
Enable true ES 2.0 shader parsing and validates that shaders will run on QUALCOMM's ES 2.0 hardware
<UL>
<LI>When this option is set, shaders are run through the same parser and shader compiler that will be used with real hardware.  This should only be turned off if a shader that should be compiling and linking is failing.  If such a case is encountered, please report a bug to QUALCOMM's handheld developer relations.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Dump Shaders to SC Dev</H2>
Creates a text file called ES2_DumpShadersScDev.txt and all the shader pairs are added to that file in a format that is readable by scltool

<H2>Output Directory</H2>
Set the output directory for all out files generated by the emulator
<UL>
<LI>These files include ES2_Debug.txt, ES2_PerfDumpSumary.txt, ES2_PerfDumpFrames.txt, and ES2_PerfDumpShaders.txt.</LI>
</UL>
