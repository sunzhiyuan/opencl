<p>(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or
without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (&quot;Utilize&quot;) the
Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that</p>

<p>any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to
Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent
that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or</p>

<p>combinations.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>2.2. Contributor Grant.</p>

<p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual
property claims:</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,

portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but
solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You
to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any
greater extent that</p>

<p>may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
combinations.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>3.1. Application of License.</p>

<p>The Modifications which You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
any terms on any Source Code version that alters or</p>

<p>restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</p>

<p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute
must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially
became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that
particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are
responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if
the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>3.3. Description of Modifications.</p>

<p>You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute
to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code
and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by
the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a)
the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
Code.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>(a) Third Party Claims.</p>

<p>If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual
property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under
this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled
&quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain
such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in
Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make</p>

<p>available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>(b) Contributor APIs.</p>

<p>If Your Modification is an application programming
interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>3.5. Required Notices.</p>

<p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code,
where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created
one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its</p>

<p>structure, then you must include such notice in a
location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to
look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or</p>

<p>liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of</p>

<p>warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
offer.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>

<p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only
if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and
if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of
how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related
documentation or collateral in which You</p>

<p>describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code.
You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,</p>

<p>provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version
under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>3.7. Larger Works.</p>

<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code
with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the
Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the
terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>5. Application of this License.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This License applies to code to which the Initial
Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>6. Versions of the License.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>6.1. New Versions.</p>

<p>Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new
versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>6.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>

<p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License published by Floris van den Berg</p>

<p>No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>6.3. Derivative Works.</p>

<p>If you create or use a modified version of this License
(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
Covered Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so
that the phrases &quot;FreeImage&quot;, `FreeImage Public License&quot;,
&quot;FIPL&quot;, or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in
your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license
contains terms which differ from the FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the
name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice
described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
this License.)</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN
&quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>8. TERMINATION.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any
termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE</p>

<p>EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as
that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
&quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software
documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
rights set forth herein.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning
subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by Dutch law provisions
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in,
the The Netherlands: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes
relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual
property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the
losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to
this Agreement shall be held in Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any litigation
relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court of
Almelo, The Netherlands with the losing party responsible for costs, including
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. Any
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to
comply with Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based</p>

<p>on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available,
the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant
factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute</p>

<p>responsibility on an equitable basis.</p>
