<h2>SDK Organization</h2>
<body>
	<hr>
	<p>Starting with Adreno SDK v3.3 we've reorganized the SDK folder structure. This new folder structure is explained in the following table:
		</p><table>
			<tbody><tr><td><b>Directory</b></td><td><b>Contents</b></td></tr>
			<tr><td>Bin</td><td>Pre-compiled executables of all SDK samples, tutorials, tools, demos built for your OS.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Development</td><td>All of the source code released in the SDK for the demos, samples, tutorials, libraries, and tools. This is where you will find Visual Studio solutions/projects, header files and libraries, and Android makefiles with the source code.</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Docs</td><td>SDK documentation.</td></tr>
		</tbody></table>
	For most demos and samples you'll find OS-specific build configurations inside the project folder. You will also find a VS2010 solution for the entire SDK in the SDK/Development/Build/VS2010 directory. VS2010 solutions are also available for the Tools and Samples only (SDK/Development/Tools/Build and SDK/Development/Samples/Build), in case you only want a subset of the SDK.
	The 64 bit versions of the Emulator and Texture Converter libraries can be found in the Bin/x64 folder.
