How to get the Browser up and Running on Linux. 
	
Note: This browser was tested with Ubuntu 12.04

The browser is now written in C# using Windows Forms and distributed as a Windows .exe binary. In order to run the binary on Linux, you will need Mono installed. There are installation instructions at http://www.mono-project.com.
Some Linux distros come with Mono preinstalled. The Latest version is recommended. 

In addition to the regular mono package, the following packages need to be downloaded. 
sudo apt-get install libmono-winforms2.0-cil
sudo apt-get install libmono-system-windows-forms-datavisualization4.0-cil
sudo apt-get install libmono-system-windows-forms4.0-cil

Once those packages are installed, you can ensure that .NET applications works on your Linux box by following the sample instructions at http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Basics#Winforms_Hello_World

If the "Hello, World" example works it is time to test the Browser.

To Launch the Browser, go to the /Bin folder and run the following command:
$>mono Browser.exe
