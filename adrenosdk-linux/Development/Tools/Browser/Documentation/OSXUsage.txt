    
    Troubleshooting OSX Browser problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: You can find this README file in:
<SDK>/Development/Tools/Browser/Documentation

The Browser is built using Gtk#. Gtk# is a Graphical User Interface Toolkit
for mono and .Net. The project binds the Gtk+ toolkit and assorted GNOME 
libraries, enabling fully native graphical Gnome application development
using Mono and the .Net development frameworks. 

You can read more about GtkSharp here:
www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp

There are several relevant Mono tools for the Browser:

MRE - Mono Runtime Environment
www.mono-project.com/Mono:Runtime

MDK - Mono Development Kit

MonoDevelop - A cross-platform IDE primarily designed for C#/.Net
www.monodevelop.com


In order to run the Browser, only the MRE and the MDK are required. The 
Browser was developed with MonoDevelop but you will not need that package
to use the Browser.

Steps for running the Browser on OSX
NOTE: This was tested on the following OSX versions:
- Mavericks 10.9.2

1) Install Mono MRE and Mono MDK
www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html

2) After intallation, you should be able to run the 'mono' command in your
Terminal and receive the mono usage prompt. 

3) There is a known issue with Mono on OSX. If you try to run the Browser
without applying this workaround, you will get the following message or 
something similar:
System.Dllnotfoundexception: gtksharpglue-2


The standard installation creates an incomplete dllmap. Therefore, you will 
have to make a slight modification to Mono's dllmap file so it can find the 
correct libraries. 

In the file: 
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/etc/mono/config

Add the following lines:
<dllmap os="osx" dll="glibsharpglue-2" target="/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/libglibsharpglue-2.so" />
<dllmap os="osx" dll="gdksharpglue-2" target="/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/libgdksharpglue-2.so" />
<dllmap os="osx" dll="gtksharpglue-2" target="/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/libgtksharpglue-2.so" />
<dllmap os="osx" dll="libpango-1.0-0.dll" target="/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/lib/libpango-1.0.0.dylib" />

NOTE: You can find this README file here - This will allow you to copy and paste:

4) In the 'Bin' directory of the Adreno SDK, you can run Run_Browser_OSX.sh
