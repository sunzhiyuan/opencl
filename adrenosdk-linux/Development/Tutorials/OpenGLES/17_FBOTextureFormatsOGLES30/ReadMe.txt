1. sRGB Textures (translation between linear and srgb???)
2. Floating-point color and depth internal formats for textures and renderbuffers (ARB_color_buffer_float, NV_depth_buffer_float, ARB_texture_float)
3. Single and double-channel (R and RG) internal formats for texture and renderbuffers (need to add the #defines for this)
