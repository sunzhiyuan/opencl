OpenGL ES Samples Android Build Instructions
2013 Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.
--------------------------------------------

These instructions show how to use the command line to build a sample and 
install it on a Qualcomm device using the Android SDK, NDK, and Apache Ant toolset. 
These instructions have been tested in Windows and cygwin environments.

Prerequisites:
* Latest Android SDK (API 14) and Android NDK
* Apache Ant
* An Android device connected to your machine (type 'adb devices' to check this)


NOTE: API 14 can be downloaded via the the Android SDK manager. The quick build/install files also specify API 14.


Instructions
------------

1. Open a command prompt.
2. In the command prompt, navigate to the sample's Android/jni directory.
3. In the Android/jni directory, run the ndk-build command:

	'$ANDROID_NDK/ndk-build'

	where ANDROID_NDK is an environment variable pointing to the root location of the NDK.

4. Navigate up one directory to the Android directory ('cd ..').
5. In the Android directory, copy the sample's assets using the InstallAssets script:

    Windows: InstallAssets.bat
	Linux: ./InstallAssets.sh (chmod 755 may be necessary)

6. Remaining in the Android directory, use the android command to update the project for Ant:

	android project update -p . -t android-14

7. Use Ant to create the sample app apk:

	ant debug (or ant release)

8. Install the sample app apk on your connected device:

	ant installd (or ant install)

9. Run the app on your device.
